# Unit 2 - Lesson 3: Introduction to JavaScript Functions
## Short Response Questions

1. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
    A parameter is a placeholder for an argument while an argument is the variable being assessed.
2. What happens when you invoke a JavaScript function with a missing argument? What about calling a function with _extra_ arguments? 
    When invoking a function with no argument it will use a _space_ as that value. While a function with an _extra_ argument will get an error. 
3. Define _hoisting_. What impact does hoisting have on the way that we structure our JavaScript programs?
    Hoisting is when javaScript takes functions and vaiables and place them into memory during the compile phase without needing to see an initiliztion. The impact that hoisting creates is that functions are able to be used anywhere in the code.
4. Which type of functions are hoisted? Which type are not?
    Declarations are hoisted but initiliztions are not.
