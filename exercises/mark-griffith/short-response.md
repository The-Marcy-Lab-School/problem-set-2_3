# Unit 2 - Lesson 3: Introduction to JavaScript Functions
## Short Response Questions

1. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
    
     A Parameter is variable in the declaration of function, it is where an arguement would be stored.

     An Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.

2. What happens when you invoke a JavaScript function with a missing argument? What about calling a function with _extra_ arguments?
3. 
     Invoking a JavaScript function with missing arguement would run but return either undefined since thats the value that is placed in its stance.
     If extra arguements are passed JavaScript runs with the first one that is passed.

3. Define _hoisting_. What impact does hoisting have on the way that we structure our JavaScript programs?
    
    Hoisting is the process of JavaScript lifting up funtions as they are invoked. 
    This way you can invoke a function before its declared without it failing immediately.

4. Which type of functions are hoisted? Which type are not?
    
    Function declarations are hoisted while function expressions are not.
